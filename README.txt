README.txt: Quick guide to coding up your strategy
Written by Frankie Lam in Quarantine.

Bidder.java - The interface that you have to code up. Namely two functions: one that takes v_t and provides a bid. Another that receives the results of the previous auction. Take care to update your budget and clock (i.e. how many auctions have happened?), as well as other information you want to maintain.

Auctioneer.java - The code that runs an auction. You don't have to understand this, but if you can find a bug here and tell us that will make us very happy (also extra credit!)

Bidder_truthful.java - Sample strategy

bidders.txt - Call "make test" to run these strategies.

Auction_Config.java, Tournament.java - As usual

As a reminder if your code throws an exception or submits an invalid, you will be considered to have submitted a bid of 0.

You know what to do - have fun!
